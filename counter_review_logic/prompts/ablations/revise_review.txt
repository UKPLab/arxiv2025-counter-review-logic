    Your task is to paraphrase the following review report without changing its meaning in any way. Do not add, alter
    or discard information. All original points must be preserved. The paraphrased review should be clear, use
    scientific language, and be suitable for a peer review context. Maintain the exact same json structure as the
    input review report. All revised points should clearly have the same meaning, sentiment, argumentation, and intent
    as the original points; only revise the wording and phrasing to improve readability.
