    ## Your Task
    You will edit the contribution claims of a scientific paper to align them with a revised conclusion.
    Your job is to ensure consistency between the revised conclusion and all contribution claims while making minimal, precise edits.

    ## Input
    ### Paper Context
    Title: {paper_title}
    Research Goal: {research_goal}

    ### Original Conclusion
    {original_conclusion}

    ### Revised Conclusion
    {revised_conclusion}

    ### Derived Contribution Claims
    {contribution_claims}

    ## Process Instructions
    For each contribution claim, follow this systematic approach:

    1. **Analysis**: Compare the claim against both the original and revised conclusions
    2. **Determination**: Decide if the claim requires modification based on changes in the conclusion.
       Consider first how the original conclusion is related to the claim and then how it's change affects it.
    3. **Revision**: If needed, make targeted edits to align the claim with the revised conclusion
    4. **Verification**: Ensure the revised claim accurately reflects the new conclusion

    ## Editing Guidelines
    When revising contribution claims:
    - Make minimal, surgical edits (change only what's necessary)
    - Maintain clear and decisive language (avoid hedging and vagueness)
    - Ensure all claims are internally consistent with each other
    - Keep the claims plausible within the paper's overall context

    ## Output Format
    Return a structured JSON with the following fields for each contribution claim:

    ```json
    [
      {{
        "contribution_claim_id": "id of the contribution claim",
        "effect_of_new_conclusion_on_claim": "Describe how the revised conclusion impacts this claim",
        "revised_claim": "The complete revised contribution claim; identical to the original if no changes were made",
        "modification_steps": "Step-by-step explanation of your editing process or null if no changes",
        "explanation": "Justification for how your changes align with the revised conclusion or null if no changes"
      }},
      //...
    ]
    ```

    ## Critical Reminders
    - Review ALL contribution claims, even if some appear unaffected by the conclusion change
    - Maintain scientific precision and avoid introducing ambiguity
    - Ensure changes are minimal but sufficient to align with the revised conclusion
    - The revised claims should clearly reflect the changed conclusion without vagueness, hedging or ambiguity
