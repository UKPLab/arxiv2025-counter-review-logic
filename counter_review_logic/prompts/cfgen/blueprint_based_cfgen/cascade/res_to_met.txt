    ## Your Task
    You will review and edit the methodological claims of a scientific paper to align them with a revised resuslt.
    Your job is to ensure consistency between the revised result and all methodological steps while making minimal, precise edits.
    A change to the underlying methodology is only necessary if the revised result points a new experiments, metrics, models,
    or other methodological aspects that were not previously mentioned. Any changes should be minimal and avoid affecting
    any of the other results.

    ## Input
    ### Paper Context
    Title: {paper_title}
    Research Goal: {research_goal}

    ### Original Result
    {original_result}

    ### Revised Result
    {revised_result}

    ### Underlying Methodological Steps
    {methodological_steps}

    ### Other Results That Need to Remain Consistent to the Methodology
    {constant_results}

    ## Process Instructions
    For each methodological step, follow this systematic approach:

    1. **Analysis**: Check if the linked methodology is actually used to generate the original result.
       If yes, analyze how the revised result might imply a different or extended experimental setup.
       - Check if the methodological step needs to be extended, e.g. adding ablations, new metrics, datasets, or models.
       - Check if the methodological step needs to be removed, e.g. if the revised result explicitly discards an experiment.
       - Check if the methodological step needs to be modified, e.g. if the revised result suggests a different but related approach
    2. **Determination**: Based on your analysis, determine the appropriate change to selected methodological steps if any.
       You should limit the changes to as few steps as possible.
    3. **Revision**: If needed, make the targeted methodological steps align with the revised result. Your edits should
      be minimal, surgical, and precise. The revised step should clearly support the revised result with concrete empirical
      steps. The changes should be clear, decisive, and unambiguous.
    4. **Verification**: Ensure the revised method accurately reflects the revised result while staying consistent with the
      overall paper context. The other results should remain correct and consistent with the changed methodology. If you
      find that there is no feasible edit that both aligns with the revised result and maintains the integrity of the
        other results, you should clearly mark this in the output.

    ## Editing Guidelines
    When revising contribution claims:
    - Make minimal, surgical edits (change only what's necessary)
    - Maintain clear and decisive language (avoid hedging and vagueness)
    - Ensure all methodological steps are internally consistent with each other
    - Keep the methodology plausible within the paper's overall context

    ## Output Format
    Return a structured JSON with the following fields for each methodological step that needs change. If there is no sensible edit to be made,
    either because none is needed or because there is no edit that fullfills all criteria, return a single null value.
    Otherwise follow the structured JSON format below.

    ```json
    [
      {{
        "method_step_number": "id of the method step",
        "effect_of_new_result_on_step": "Describe how the revised result impacts this method",
        "revised_step": "The complete revised methodological step",
        "modification_steps": "Step-by-step explanation of your editing process or null if no changes",
        "explanation": "Justification for how your changes align with the revised result or null if no changes"
      }},
      //...
    ]
    ```

    ## Critical Reminders
    - Review ALL methodoloical steps, even if some appear unaffected by the conclusion change
    - Maintain scientific precision and avoid introducing ambiguity
    - Ensure changes are minimal but sufficient to align with the revised result
    - The revised method should clearly reflect the changed result without vagueness, hedging or ambiguity
    - Return null if no changes are nedded or it is not feasible to make changes
    - Be conservative with the number of steps that need to be changed
