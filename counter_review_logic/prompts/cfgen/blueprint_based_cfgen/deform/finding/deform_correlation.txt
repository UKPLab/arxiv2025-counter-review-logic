    ## Your Task
    Consider the following finding from an NLP/AI research paper decomposed into its claims, justifications, and modifiers.
    The finding makes a claim about a correlation/associational/statistical relationship between two observations/variables/systems/behaviors.
    Your task is to propose a modified version of the finding, which claims a causal relationship instead. This means, if
    the original finding states "A tends to grow with B", the modified version should state "A is caused by B". Your modification should
    entail *minimal* changes to the original finding (i.e. least amount of edits), be plausible in the context of the
    paper, and result in a fallacy (i.e. it should be deceptive and convincing). The resulting wording should make very explicit
    the causal relationship.

    If you disagree that the finding is a correlation, you should return an empty JSON object. If you cannot find a
    plausible causal relationship, you should also return an empty JSON object. If the finding is already a causal relationship,
    you should return an empty JSON object.

    ## Input Structure
    - **Paper Title**: {title}
    - **Research Goal**: {research_goal}

    - **Finding**: {finding}
    - **Finding Components**: {finding_components}

    ## Output Format
    ```json
    {{
        "analysis_correlation_components": {{
            "variableA": "one side of the correlation in the claim",
            "variableB": "the other side of the correlation in the claim",
            "associational_relationship": "the correlation/statistical/associational relation in the claim"
        }}
        "causal_relationship": {{
            "cause": "one of the variables serving as the cause in the modified claim",
            "consequence": "the other variable serving as the consequence in the modified claim",
            "causal_relation": "the causal relation in the modified claim consistent to the correlational relationship"
        }},
        "modified_finding": "the modified finding with the inverted causal relationship",
        "modification_steps": "describe precisely how the paper needs to be revised to reflect the modification",
        "explanation": "the explanation of the modification and why it is plausible in the context of the paper",
      }}
    ```

    ## Analysis Process
    For each conclusion:
    1. Read carefully to understand its meaning in context of the paper
    2. Identify its correlation components
    3. Come up with a plausible causal relationship
    4. Create a modified conclusion that reflects the causal relationship with minimal edits
    5. Your edits should be assertive and clear without vagueness, uncertainty or hedging.
    6. Provide complete JSON following the format above. If you cannot find a plausible causal relationship, return an empty JSON object.
