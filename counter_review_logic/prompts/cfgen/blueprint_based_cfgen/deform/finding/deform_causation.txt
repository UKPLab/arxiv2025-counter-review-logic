    ## Your Task
    Consider the following finding from an NLP/AI research paper decomposed into its claims, justifications, and modifiers.
    The finding makes a claim about a causal relationship between two observations/variables/systems/behaviors. Your task is
    to propose a modified version of the finding, which inverts the order of the causal relationship. This means, if
    the original finding states "A causes B", the modified version should state "B causes A". Your modification should
    entail *minimal* changes to the original finding (i.e. least amount of edits), be plausible in the context of the
    paper, and result in a fallacy (i.e. it should be deceptive and convincing). It might be necessary to modify the
    precise causal relationship in the inverted version to make it plausible.

    If you disagree that this statement is a causal relationship, please return an empty JSON object. If you cannot
    find a plausible inverted causal relationship, please return an empty JSON object.

    ## Input Structure
    - **Paper Title**: {title}
    - **Research Goal**: {research_goal}

    - **Finding**: {finding}
    - **Finding Components**: {finding_components}

    ## Output Format
    ```json
    {{
        "analysis_causal_components": {{
            "cause": "the cause in the claim",
            "consequence": "the consequence in the claim",
            "causal_relation": "the causal relation in the claim"

        "inverted_causal_components": {{
            "cause": "the cause in the modified claim which is the consequence in the original claim",

            "causal_relation": "the causal relation in the modified claim which might be different from the original claim"
        }},
        "modified_finding": "the modified finding with the inverted causal relationship",
        "modification_steps": "describe precisely how the paper needs to be revised to reflect the modification",
        "explanation": "the explanation of the modification and why it is plausible in the context of the paper",
      }}
    ```

    ## Analysis Process
    For each conclusion:
    1. Read carefully to understand its meaning in context of the paper
    2. Identify its causal components
    3. Come up with a plausible inverted causal relationship
    4. Create a modified conclusion that reflects the inverted causal relationship with minimal edits
    5. Your edits should be assertive and clear without vagueness, uncertainty or hedging.
    6. Provide complete JSON following the format above. If you cannot find a plausible inverted causal relationship, return an empty JSON object.
