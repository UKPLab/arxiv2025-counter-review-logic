    ## Your Task
    Analyze the finding from an NLP/AI research paper. Consider its summary but also the literal claim provided.
    Your task:
    1. Identifying key components (claim, justification, modifiers)
    2. Classifying each component according to the framework below

    ## Input Structure
    - **Paper Title**: {title}
    - **Research Goal**: {research_goal}

    - **Finding**: {finding}

    ## Classification Framework

    ### Claim Types
    **Model-Related**:
    - **Model comparison**: "Model X outperforms Model Y on task Z"
    - **Model quality**: "Model X has beneficial/detrimental property Y"
    - **Model property**: "Model X exhibits neutral property Y"
    - **Model behavior**: "Model X demonstrates behavior Y under conditions Z"
    - **Model performance**: "Model X achieves performance Y on task Z"
    - **Model tradeoff**: "Model X excels in quality Y but sacrifices quality W"

    **Non-Model Related**:
    - **Theory/method/dataset comparison**: "Method X surpasses Method Y under conditions Z"
    - **Theory/method/dataset quality**: "Dataset X has beneficial/detrimental property Y"
    - **Theory/method/dataset behavior**: "Method X exhibits behavior Y under conditions Z"
    - **Theory/method/dataset tradeoff**: "Method X excels in quality Y but sacrifices quality W"

    ### Justification Types
    - **Metrics**: Supported by empirical measurements (e.g., "F1-Score increases by 2 points")
    - **Property**: Supported by proven properties (e.g., "converges in log(n)")
    - **Experiments**: Supported by experimental results (e.g., "outperforms SOTA across all tasks")

    ### Modifier Types
    - **Condition**: Restrictions under which the claim holds; this is not the same as a general context but a specific statement that restricts the claim to a certain scope/condition/etc.
    - **Causal relation**: Specifies cause-effect relationship; the relationship should be explicit (because of, therefore, causes, etc.)
    - **Correlation relation**: Notes correlation without causation; the relationship should be explicit (correlates with, associated with, as X grows, Y grows, etc.)
    - **Significance**: Makes statistical significance claims; the significance should be explicitly mentioned (significant, p-values, etc.)
    - **Vagueness/speculation**: Contains uncertain or speculative elements
    - **Contrast**: Highlights discrepancy between expectations and results

    ## Output Format
    ```json
      {{
        "claim_types": [
            "primary claim type",
            "secondary claim type (if applicable)"
          ],
          "explanation_for_claim_types": "Brief explanation of classification choices",
          "justification": "justification type or null if absent",
          "modifiers": [
            "modifier type 1 if present",
            "modifier type 2 if present"
          ]
      }}
    ```

    ## Analysis Process
    1. Read carefully to understand the meaning of the finding in context of the paper
    2. Identify and classify the claim, justification, and modifiers
    3. Provide complete JSON for all conclusions following the format above

    Analyze the conclusion thoroughly but concisely, ensuring your classifications accurately reflect the content and structure of each scientific claim.
    Closely adhere to the classification types and the modification options for each type. Spend special attention to the modifiers as they are difficult to identify.
    Avoid selecting many claim types; precision is more important.
