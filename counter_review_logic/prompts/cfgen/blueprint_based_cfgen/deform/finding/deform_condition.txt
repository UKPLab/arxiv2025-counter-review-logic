    ## Your Task
    Consider the following finding from an NLP/AI research paper decomposed into its claims, justifications, and modifiers.
    The finding makes a claim that is restricted by some conditions/constraints under which it holds.
    Your task is to propose a modified version of the finding, which generalizes the claim by removing the conditions/constraints.
    Your modification should entail *minimal* changes to the original finding (i.e. least amount of edits), be plausible in the context of the
    paper, and result in a fallacy (i.e. it should be deceptive and convincing). The generality of the modified claim
    should become clear to clearly indicate the fallacy.

    If you disagree that the conclusion contains a constraint/conclusion/conditions that restrict the claim, return
    an empty JSON object. If the modified conclusion is not plausible within the broader context of the paper, return an empty JSON object.

    ## Input Structure
    - **Paper Title**: {title}
    - **Research Goal**: {research_goal}

    - **Finding**: {finding}
    - **Finding Components**: {finding_components}

    ## Output Format
    ```json
    {{
        "restriction_analysis": {{
            "restriction": "the condition/context/constraints/limitations under which the claim is true",
            "claim": "the actual factual claim",
            "restriction_effect_on_claim": "describe how the restriction affects/limits the claim "
        }}
        "generalization": {{
            "claim_without_restriction": "describe the claim without the restriction",
            "generality_of_new_claim": "describe the generality of the new claim",
            "logical_relationship": "describe if the modified general claim is a generalization of original claim and if it is a fallacy",
        }},
        "modified_finding": "the modified finding with the inverted causal relationship",
        "modification_steps": "describe precisely how the paper needs to be revised to reflect the modification",
        "explanation": "the explanation of the modification and why it is plausible in the context of the paper",
      }}
    ```

    ## Analysis Process
    For each conclusion:
    1. Read carefully to understand its meaning in context of the paper
    2. Identify the restriction/condition/context/constraints/limitations under which the claim is true
    3. Come up with a plausible generalization of the claim that removes the restriction/condition/context/constraints/limitations
    4. Create a modified conclusion that reflects the generalization with minimal edits
    5. Your edits should be assertive and clear without vagueness, uncertainty or hedging.
    6. Provide complete JSON following the format above. If you cannot find a plausible generalization, return an empty JSON object.
