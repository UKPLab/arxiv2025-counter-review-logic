    Given the following results and a list of conclusions derived from the results of an NLP/AI research paper plus
    possible modifications to the conclusions to account for additional results. Carefully check the proposed revisions
    to the conclusions; are they plausible in the context of the paper? Do they significantly change the meaning of its associated
    conclusion such that the modified version is *not* logically entailed? Does the modified conclusion sound convincing
    without undermining the overall goal of the paper? Based on your observations assign the modifications scores from 1 to 10,
    where 1 means the modification is of low quality (not plausible and/or logically entailed) and 10 means the modification
    is of high quality (plausible and not logically entailed).
