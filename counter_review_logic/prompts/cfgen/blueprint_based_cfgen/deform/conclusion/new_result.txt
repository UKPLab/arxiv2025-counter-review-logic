    # Research Result Generator: Create Plausible Alternative Findings
    ## Task Description
    Your task is to generate a plausible additional research result that is relevant to but not fully aligned with the
    conclusion of an AI/NLP research paper. This new result should be logically consistent with existing findings but
    demonstrate that the original conclusion doesn't necessarily cover all implications. The resulting conclusion
    should also sound convincing in the context of the storyline of the paper. Be as creative as possible and think
    outside the box while ensuring scientific plausibility.

    ## Input Context
    ```
    Paper Title: {paper_title}
    Research Goal: {research_goal}
    Existing Results: {results}
    Original Conclusion: {conclusion}
    ```

    ## Requirements
    1. Create ONE new research result that:
       - Is scientifically plausible within the paper's domain
       - Is relevant to the existing research findings
       - Does not contradict the original results
       - Shows that the original conclusion doesn't fully capture all implications

    2. The new result should represent ONE of the following scenarios:
       - A new experimental condition with additional outcomes
       - A modified version of an existing experiment revealing new insights
       - An analysis of the data from a different perspective
       - A test on a new dataset or domain

    3. The relationship between conclusions must satisfy this logical test:
       - Even if the original conclusion is true, your new conclusion is not necessarily true
       - This creates a logical gap between the original and new findings

    4. The modified conclusion should sound convincing and align with the storyline of the paper.

    ## Output Format
    First generate a plausible new result for each of the above specified variants and list them. Then select the most
    promising and creative one and return it as a structured JSON object with the following fields:

    ```json
    {{
      "new_result_summary": "A concise 1-2 sentence description of the new research finding",
      "experimental_setup": "Description of how this result could be obtained (data, methods, analysis approach)",
      "relevance_to_conclusion": "How this result connects to the original conclusion",
      "logical_gap_explanation": "Why this result shows that the original conclusion, even if true, doesn't necessarily imply your new conclusion"
    }}
    ```

    ## Remember
    - Be specific and detailed in your new result
    - Ensure scientific plausibility within the research domain
    - Maintain consistency with original results
    - Focus on creating a logical gap rather than direct contradiction
