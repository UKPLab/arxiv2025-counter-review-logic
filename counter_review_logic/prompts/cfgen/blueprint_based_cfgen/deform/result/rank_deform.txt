    Your task is to evaluate and rank a set of possible modifications to the results of a research paper aimed at
    invalidating a conclusion from the same paper. For each conclusion, one modified result that underlies it is provided.
    Rank the modifications based on their plausibility in the paper context, how well they misalign with the original
    conclusion, how convincing/deceiving they sound, and how minimally they are. Based on your observations assign the
    modifications scores from 1 to 10, where 1 means the modification is of low quality (not plausible and/or logically
    entailed) and 10 means the modification is of high quality (plausible and not logically entailed).
