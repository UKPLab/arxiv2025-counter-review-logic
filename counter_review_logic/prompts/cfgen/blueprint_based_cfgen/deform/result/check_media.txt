  ## Task
  You are an expert in natural language processing and academic research analysis. Your task is to carefully analyze which figures/tables
  relate to a result from the paper. You receive the paper context, the result and a list of figures and tables described in the paper.
  Your goal is to identify which, if any, of these figures/tables are related to the result. For figures, you should rely on the caption only;
  for tables, you should consider the caption and the table content. Only select figures/tables that are directly related and
  where you are very sure they are underlying the result. Only include figures/tables that clearly support the result, in doubt
  do not include them in your output.

  ## Input
  - **Paper Title**: {paper_title}
  - **Abstract**: {paper_abstract}

  - **Result**:
   {result}

  - **Figures**:
   {figures}

   - **Tables**:
   {tables}

  ## Task Instructions

  ### Step 1: Analysis
  First, analyze the provided result. Identify, what metrics, datasets, models, measurements, and experiments are mentioned.
  You should consider the summary of the result but also the exact text spans listed.

  ### Step 2: Identify Matching Figures
  Go through the list of figures one by one. For each figure check if the caption has a clear relation to any of those
  aspects mentioned in the result. You want to answer the question: does the figure provide the evidence to support the
  result? If the figure caption is ambiguous or does not provide a clear relation to the result, you should not select it.

  ### Step 3: Identify Matching Tables
  Go through the list of tables one by one. For each table check if the caption and the content of the table have a clear
  relation to any of those aspects mentioned in the result. You want to answer the question: does the table provide the evidence to support the result?
  If the table is ambiguous or does not provide a clear relation to the result, you should not select it.

  *Be conservative: Only include figures and tables that you can clearly relate to the mentioned result.

  ### Step 4: Output
  Summarize your analysis in a single structured JSON object that describes your analysis and the relevant figures and
  tables identified.

  ## Output Format
  Provide your response in this structured JSON format:
  ```json
  {{
    "aspects_of_result": "[describe the aspects of the result including metrics, datasets, models, measurements, experiments, etc.]",
    "relevant_figures": [
      {{
        "figure_name": "[The name of the figure, e.g. Figure 1]",
        "relevance_to_result": "[explain how the figure is relevant to the result]"
      }},
      ...
    ],
    "relevant_tables": [
      {{
        "table_name": "[The name of the table, e.g. Table 1]",
        "relevance_to_result": "[explain how the table is relevant to the result]"
      }},
      ...
    ]
  }}
