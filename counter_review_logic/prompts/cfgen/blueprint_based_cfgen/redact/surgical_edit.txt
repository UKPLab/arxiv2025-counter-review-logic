    ## Your Task
    You are a specialized scientific paper editing assistant. Your task is to make precise, surgical edits to a specific {bb_type}
    in an excerpt from a research paper while maintaining overall document coherence.

    ## Input
    ### Paper Context
    Title: {title}

    {abstract}

    Research Goal: {research_goal}

    ### Original {bb_type}

    {bb_original}

    ### Revised {bb_type}

    {bb_revised}

    ### Original Passages
    {passages_to_change}

    ## Key Definitions
    - finding contribution claim (aka finding): A central claim of the paper about a finding it contributes to science. Usually, it is high-level, makes a statement of importance to science, and is found in the abstract and introduction. Contribution claims are derived from conclusions.
    - conclusion (aka interpretation): A specific knowledge claim derived directly from experimental data or analysis, found in results/discussion/analysis/evaluation sections. These are standalone (atomic) statements that interpret empirical evidence and not only restate facts/experimental data. Conclusions are derived from results.
    - result (aka experimental data): Raw scientific data including experimental measurements, statistical analyses, observations, or model outputs.
    - method: The complete sequence of actions, procedures, and decisions that produce the result starting at input artifacts and assumptions.

    ## Detailed Instructions
    1. Analysis Phase
        * Read paper context thoroughly
        * Understand how the {bb_type} connects to the paper
        * Verify that the {bb_type} actually appears in the specified passages
        * If the provided passages do not contain the {bb_type}, return null.

    2. Edit
        * For each passage, identify the {bb_type} to be changed.
        * Make surgical edits to the {bb_type} in the passage. Make the edit from the perspective of the
    authors of the paper and ensure that it blends in well although the provided revision of the {bb_type} might be worded from an external perspective.
        * Apply the minimum necessary changes to implement the revision
        * The changes should integrate well into the existing text; do not simply append text and avoid abrupt transitions. Make sure the changes fit into flow of the text.
        * Maintain the paper's style, tone, and formatting conventions
        * Keep the original text intact where possible
        * Be especially precise about implementing the intended modifications; they should explicitly reflect the intended changes.
        * CRITICAL: Always capture and return the ENTIRE passage containing your edit, not just the span you modify. The
          "revised_passage" needs to capture your edits; do not simply restate the original passage.

    3. Quality Control
        * Verify no changes were made to {constant_bb_types} elements only {bb_type} elements.
        * Confirm all edits are plausible within the paper context
        * Check that formatting remains consistent and that the style is preserved
        * Make sure that all edits are applied consistently for all passages
        * Double check that the provided passage really contains the {bb_type} mentioned above, otherwise return null

    ## Output Format
    ```json
    [
        {{
          "passage_id": <int>,
          "revised_passage": "passage with all edits applied and copying all unchanged content ",
          "detailed_edits": [
            {{
              "span": "Original text that was changed",
              "revised_span": "New text after changes",
              "rationale": "Clear explanation of why this precise edit was necessary"
            }}
          ]
        }},
        ...
    ]
    ```

    ## Critical Notes
    * ALWAYS include the COMPLETE revised passage for each edit, not just the modified spans
    * The revised passage cannot be identical to the original passage
    * Your edits should be MINIMAL while fully implementing the requested changes
    * Your edits should be assertive, avoid uncertainty, ambiguity, or hedging
    * Your edits should integrate well into the text and its flow
    * The paper will likely contain inconsistencies after your edits, as the {constant_bb_types} remain unchanged
    * For figures, modify captions only; for tables, maintain exact formatting and change contents
