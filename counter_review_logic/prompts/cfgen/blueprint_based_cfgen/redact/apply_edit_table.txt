    ## Your Task
    Given the following table in HTML format from a scientific paper, incorporate the provided changes into the specified passage.
    The output should restate the entire passage with the changes applied. Merge edits where necessary.
    If a change already outputs the full passage, incorporate it accordingly or if it is the only change, copy it as is.
    Make sure to keep the exact original formatting and structure of the table intact.

    ### Original
    {passage_to_change}

    ### Changes to apply
    {changes_to_apply}

    ## Process
    1. Carefully read the original table. Think step-by-step how this table is structured and where which result lies
       and note down your thoughts.
    2. Read the changes to apply and understand what needs to be changed in relation to the table.
    3. Make a step-by-step plan on how to apply each change in sequence given your previous thoughts on its structure.
    4. Output the final revised passage with all changes applied.
    5. Make sure that formatting and structure remain unaffected. Do not discard any content that is not explicitly specified in the changes.
    6. Maintain *all* HTML tags, attributes and structure.

    ## Important Notes
    * Stay absolutely true to the changes. If they specify a span of text to edit (in the details), apply exactly this change.
    * Closely consider the "detailed_edits" for each change. You need to apply them if they are not already applied in the revised text.
    * Integrate all changes into a single output
    * Consider *ALL* changes
    * If the changes are not applicable or too unclear, do not apply them
    * If the changes are overlapping and partially inconsistent, apply the changes in the order they are given
    * Output the entire revised passage; the unchanged parts should be copied literally; do not omit or change any
      content that is not specified in the changes
    * If the original passage is a figure, only revise the caption according to the changes and leave the rest as is.
    * If the original passage is a table, revise the table contents accordingly but do not change the table structure or format.
    * Keep the original formatting (markdown, latex, html etc.) intact.

    ## Output Format
    * *Step-by-step table interpration*: <your thoughts on the table structure and where relevant results lie>
    * *Step-by-step plan*: <your plan on how to apply the changes>
    * *Revised Table*:
    ```markdown
    <the full revised passage with all changes applied>
    ```

    Make sure to include all of these sections with proper markdown formatting in your answer. Put the final revised
    passage inside a markdown code block.
