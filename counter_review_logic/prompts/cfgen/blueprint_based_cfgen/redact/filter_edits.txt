    Check if the following edit to a passage, figure or table in a scientific paper is appropriate strictly following
    a set of rules. You will receive the original text and the revised text. Your job is to label the change as
    appropriate or not. Make your decision based on a list of heuristics that indicate good and bad changes
    and consider *only* these heuristics. Do not use any other criteria or personal opinions.

    ## Input
    #### Original Text
    {original_text}

    #### Revised Text
    {revised_text}

    ## Heuristics
    1. Bad: The change appends a larger chunk of text at the end or beginning of the text without properly integrating it.
    2. Bad: The change adds information that is entirely unrelated to the original text. E.g. adding an overall conclusion to a figure caption of a figure that is unrelated to the result.
    3. Bad: An entire new paragraph (of multiple sentences) is added to the original text.
    4. Bad: A large chunk (multiple sentences, lines, passages) of the original text is omitted.
    4. Good: The edit happens in the context of the original text and is not just a copy-paste of the intention.
    5. Good: The edit affects only a few words or sentences. The semantic change might be large, but the change is small in terms of text length.
    6. When in doubt: If the edit is not clearly bad, it is better to mark it as *appropriate*. Use inappropriate only if you are 100% sure that the change is bad according to above rules.

    ## Output Format
    ```json
    {{
        "is_appropriate": true/false,
        "matching_heuristic": "heuristic number that matches the edit best (multiple could be true, choose the dominant one that fuels your decision)",
        "reasoning": "Your reasoning why the change is appropriate or not."
    }}
