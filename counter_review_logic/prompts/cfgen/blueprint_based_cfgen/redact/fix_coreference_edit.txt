    ## Your Task
    You are a specialized scientific paper editing assistant. Your task is to make precise, surgical edits referring to a specific {bb_type}
    in paragraphs of a scientific research paper. The {bb_type} has been changed as described below and all coreferences to it should be
    updated accordingly to ensure the alignment to the changed {bb_type}.

    ## Input
    ### Paper Context
    Title: {title}

    {abstract}

    Research Goal: {research_goal}

    ### Original {bb_type}

    {bb_original}

    ### Revised {bb_type}

    {bb_revised}

    ### Revised Passages of the {bb_type}

    {changed_passages}

    ### Coreference Passage to Edit

    {coreference_to_change}

    ## Key Definitions
    - finding conclusion claim (aka finding): A central claim of the paper about a finding it contributes to science. Usually, it is high-level, makes a statement of importance to science, and is found in the abstract and introduction. Contribution claims are derived from conclusions.
    - conclusion (aka interpretation): A specific knowledge claim derived directly from experimental data or analysis, found in results/discussion/analysis/evaluation sections. These are standalone (atomic) statements that interpret empirical evidence and not only restate facts/experimental data. Conclusions are derived from results.
    - result (aka experimental data): Raw scientific data including experimental measurements, statistical analyses, observations, or model outputs.
    - method: The complete sequence of actions, procedures, and decisions that produce the result starting at input artifacts and assumptions.

    ## Detailed Instructions
    1. Analysis Phase
        * Read paper context thoroughly
        * Understand how the {bb_type} is related to the coreference passages
        * Verify that the {bb_type} is actually referenced in the passages.
        * A true coreference restates or explicitly refers to the {bb_type}.
        * Underlying {constant_bb_types} elements should not be changed although they might sound similar.

    2. Edit
        * For the passage, determine if there is need for change.
        * Make surgical edits to make it consistent to the revised {bb_type} and its revised passage.
        * Apply the minimum necessary changes to implement the revision
        * Maintain the paper's style, tone, and formatting conventions
        * Keep the original text intact where possible
        * Be especially precise about implementing the intended modifications; they should explicitly reflect the intended changes.
        * CRITICAL: Always capture and return the ENTIRE passage containing your edit, not just the span you modify

    3. Quality Control
        * Verify no changes were made to {constant_bb_types} elements only {bb_type} elements.
        * Confirm all edits are plausible within the paper context
        * Check that formatting remains consistent and that the style is preserved

    If a coreference passage does not need any changes, return null.

    ## Output Format
    ```json
    {{
      "revised_passage": "passage with all edits applied and copying all unchanged content ",
      "detailed_edits": [
        {{
          "span": "Original text that was changed",
          "revised_span": "New text after changes",
          "rationale": "Clear explanation of why this precise edit was necessary"
        }}
      ]
    }}
    ```

    ## Critical Notes
    * ALWAYS include the COMPLETE passage for each edit, not just the modified spans
    * Your edits should be MINIMAL while fully implementing the requested changes
    * Your edits should be assertive, avoid uncertainty, ambiguity, or hedging
    * For figures, modify captions only; for tables, maintain exact formatting

  Thanks for you answer. It seems like you do not apply any changes to the passage. Please reconsider the
  passage, the edit intentions and the instructions above to provide surgical edits to the passage and make sure
  that no changes are needed. Please fix the output json to reflect the changes and include the detailed changes.
  Only if the passage is not relevant at all to the edit intentions, you should return it without edits.

  NOTE: Remember to provide the revised answer in the exact same json format as the initial answer.
