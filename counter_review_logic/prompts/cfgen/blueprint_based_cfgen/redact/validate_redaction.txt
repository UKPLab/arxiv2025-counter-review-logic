  ## Task Definition
  You are an expert academic editor tasked with evaluating whether a paper revision appropriately implements an intended edit while preserving essential elements. You will receive:
  1. The original paper
  2. The revised version
  3. The stated edit intention
  4. A list of elements that must remain unchanged

  ## Input
  ### Original Paper
  ```md
  {original_paper}
  ```

  ### Revised Paper
  ```md
  {revised_paper}
  ```

  ### Edit Intention
  {edit_intention}

  ### Specific Changes
  {specific_changes}

  ### Protected Elements
  {protected_elements}


  ## Evaluation Instructions
  Analyze the revision thoroughly and systematically using the following framework:

  ### 1. Intention Implementation
  Evaluate whether the revision accomplishes the stated intention:
  - Does it address the specific changes requested?
  - Is the implementation precise and clear?
  - Does it maintain academic clarity and rigor?

  ### 2. Change Minimality
  Assess whether changes were kept to the necessary minimum:
  - Are modifications limited to only what's required for the edit intention?
  - Do unrelated sections remain intact?
  - Are changes surgical rather than sweeping?

  ### 3. Content Preservation
  Verify that existing content was properly preserved:
  - Was content only modified or reduced, not expanded?
  - Are all major sections of the original paper still present?
  - Is the overall structure maintained?

  ### 4. Element Integrity
  Check figures and tables for alignment with originals:
  - Are they still properly labeled and referenced?
  - Do they maintain the same structure?

  ### 5. Protected Element Preservation
  Confirm that specified protected elements remain completely unchanged:
  - Have all elements on the "do not change" list been preserved exactly?
  - Check for subtle modifications that might have occurred inadvertently.
  - Does the overall structure of the paper remain the same?

  ### 6. Change Consistency
  Evaluate internal consistency of the changes:
  - Do all changes support the same edit intention?
  - Are there contradictions among the changes?
  - Note: The paper's overall argument might be inconsistent (acceptable), but the changes themselves should be consistent.

  ### 7. Completeness
  Are all relevant parts of the paper revised to realize the edit intention?
  - Check all sections for relevant passages to the edit intention, are they covered?
  - Only those on the "do not change list" should be ignored
  - Are all relevant figures and tables updated?

  ## Response Format
  Provide your analysis in the following structured format:

  ### Intention Implementation
  [Detailed assessment with specific examples]
  Score: [1-10]

  ### Change Minimality
  [Detailed assessment with specific examples]
  Score: [1-10]

  ### Content Preservation
  [Detailed assessment with specific examples]
  Score: [1-10]

  ### Element Integrity
  [Detailed assessment with specific examples]
  Score: [1-10]

  ### Protected Element Preservation
  [Detailed assessment with specific examples]
  Score: [1-10]

  ### Change Consistency
  [Detailed assessment with specific examples]
  Score: [1-10]

  ### Completeness
  [Detailed assessment with specific examples]
  Score: [1-10]

  ### Overall Assessment
  [Summary of key findings]

  ### Actionable Recommendations
  - [Specific recommendation 1]
  - [Specific recommendation 2]
  - [Additional recommendations as needed]

  ### Final Verdict: [REVISE/REJECT]
  - Choose ACCEPT if the revisions are very good or perfect and need no further changes
  - Choose REVISE for issues that can be fixed with minor effort
  - Choose REJECT if fundamental problems exist that would require major reworking

  ## Examples of Dealbreakers (Automatic REJECT)
  - Addition of substantial new content beyond the scope of the edit intention
  - Removal of major sections without justification
  - Multiple protected elements were modified
  - Changes fundamentally alter the paper's core thesis in ways not specified by the edit intention
  - Elements have been completely redesigned rather than appropriately modified
  - No edits have been applied
  - The edits have nothing to do with the intended modifications

  ## Process Approach
  1. First read both papers carefully and identify all changes
  2. Map changes to the stated edit intention
  3. Check all protected elements for preservation
  4. Evaluate each criterion methodically with specific examples
  5. Provide clear evidence for your scoring decisions
  6. Make recommendations that are specific and actionable
