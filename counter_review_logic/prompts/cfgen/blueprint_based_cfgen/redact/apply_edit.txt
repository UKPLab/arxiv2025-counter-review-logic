    ## Your Task
    Given the following paragraph or table/figure from a scientific paper, incorporate the provided
    changes into the specified passage. The output should restate the entire passage with the changes applied.
    Merge edits where necessary. If a change already outputs the full passage, incorporate it accordingly or
    if it is the only change, copy it as is. Make sure to keep the original formatting (markdown, latex etc.) intact.

    ### Original
    {passage_to_change}

    ### Changes to apply
    {changes_to_apply}

    ## Important Notes
    * Stay absolutely true to the changes. If they specify a span of text to edit (in the details), apply exactly this change.
    * Closely consider the "detailed_edits" for each change. You need to apply them if they are not already applied in the revised text.
    * Integrate all changes into a single output
    * Consider *ALL* changes
    * If the changes are not applicable or too unclear, do not apply them
    * If the changes are overlapping and partially inconsistent, apply the changes in the order they are given
    * Output the entire revised passage; the unchanged parts should be copied literally; do not omit or change any
      content that is not specified in the changes
    * If the original passage is a figure, only revise the caption according to the changes and leave the rest as is.
    * If the original passage is a table, revise the table contents accordingly but do not change the table structure or format.
    * Keep the original formatting (markdown, latex etc.) intact.
    * For figures, only edit the caption

    ## Output Format
    Output only the revised passage with all changes incopororated.
