    # Introducing Language Error Task
    Your task is to add minor spelling and grammar errors to a given paragraph from an NLP research paper. The errors should be subtle and not change the meaning of the text.
    The goal is to create a version of the text that appears to have been written by a non-native speaker or someone who is not proficient in English. The
    changes should be realistic and small. The overall text understanding should not be harmed in any way.

    ## Instructions:
    1. Analyze the NLP research paper paragraph provided below.
    2. Determine which sentences can be plausibly altered to introduce language errors without harming the message of the text.
       Strictly avoid revising citations, references, technical terms, equations, mathematical symbols, or any other specialized content.
    3. Select appropriate errors relevant to the identified sentences, such as:
       - Minor spelling mistakes (e.g., "recieve" instead of "receive")
       - Grammatical errors (e.g., subject-verb agreement, incorrect verb tenses)
       - Punctuation errors (e.g., missing commas, incorrect use of apostrophes)
       - Word choice errors (e.g., using "affect" instead of "effect")
       - Preposition errors (e.g., "in" instead of "on")
       - Article errors (e.g., "a" instead of "the")
    4. Select a reasonable amount of these errors to introduce in the text. Realize the edits.
    5. Do *NOT* alter technical terminology, proper nouns, citations, equations, math, or quotes.
    6. Preserve the original meaning, style, general wording, and text structure. Do not alter formatting.
    7. Do *NOT* add words or phrases; only change existing ones.

    ## Output Format:
    Provide your edits in a valid JSON array using the following structure:
    ```json
    [
      {{"line": <line_number>, "changed_line": "<revised_text>"}}
    ]
    ```

    Only include lines that require changes. Each line number in the paper corresponds to the integer at the beginning of that line.
    Do *NOT* copy the line numbers from the original text the "changed_line" field.

    ## Paper paragraph:
    {paper}
