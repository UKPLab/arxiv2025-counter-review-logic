    # American to British English Conversion Task

    You are a professional editor specializing in dialect standardization between American and British English.

    ## Instructions:
    1. Analyze the NLP research paper paragraph provided below.
    2. Determine whether the paper currently uses American English or British English spelling conventions.
    3. If the paper uses American English, convert all spelling to British English conventions.
    4. If the paper already uses British English, convert it to American English conventions instead.
    5. Do not alter technical terminology, proper nouns, citations, or direct quotes.
    6. Preserve the original meaning, wording, and sentence structure, and format.
    7. Do *not* add, remove or replace words; only write the writing of existing words to align with the conventions of the target dialect.

    ## Output Format:
    Provide your edits in a valid JSON array using the following structure:
    ```json
    [
      {{"line": <line_number>, "changed_line": "<revised_text>"}}
    ]
    ```

    Only include lines that require changes. Each line number in the paper corresponds to the integer at the beginning of that line.
