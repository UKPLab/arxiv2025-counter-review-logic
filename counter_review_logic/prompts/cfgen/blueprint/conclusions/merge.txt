    Your task is to analyze extracted conclusions/findings from a research paper and eliminate redundancies to produce a concise list of distinct, atomic conclusions.

    ## TASK OVERVIEW
    Analyze the provided research paper conclusions, identify and merge overlapping conclusions, and create a consolidated JSON output.

    ## INPUT DATA

    ```
    ### Input conclusions:
    {conclusions_with_ids}

    ### Full paper text:
    {paper}
    ```

    ## DEFINITIONS

    - **Conclusion/Finding**: A specific knowledge claim derived directly from experimental data or analysis, found in results/discussion/analysis/evaluation sections. These are standalone (atomic) statements that interpret empirical evidence.
    - **Overlapping Conclusions**: Findings that provide identical or substantially similar insights based on the same experiment, analysis, or measurement

    ## ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

    1. **Initial Assessment**
       - Read through all extracted conclusions carefully
       - Understand each conclusion's context, claim and relationship to the overall paper
       - Note any potential overlaps or duplications in the data

    2. **Deduplication Process**
       - Compare each conclusion against all others using these criteria:
         * Based on the same experimental setup or methodology?
         * Same or very similar claim or observation?
         * Based on the same dataset being analyzed?
         * Based on the same or very similar research results?
       - For conclusions meeting multiple criteria above, mark as candidates for merging

    3. **Conclusion Consolidation**
       - For identical conclusion: Select the most comprehensive description
       - For partially overlapping conclusions: Create a unified description capturing all unique elements
       - For each merged conclusion:
         * Aggregate all location references (figures, tables, paragraphs)
         * Track all original conclusion IDs that contributed to the merged conclusion

    4. **Verification**
       - Cross-reference with the paper text when uncertain about potential overlaps
       - Ensure every original conclusion is accounted for in your final output
       - Verify that merging decisions preserve scientific accuracy and nuance

    ## OUTPUT FORMAT

    Return your analysis as a JSON array with this structure:

    ```json
    [
      {{
        "conclusion_summary": "Concise statement of the interpreted finding",
        "evidences": [
          {{
            "location": "Specific paragraph, figure, or table number",
            "span": "Exact text span from the paper that contains the conclusion"
          }}
        ],
        "context": "Description of the experimental setup, dataset, or analytical method that produced this finding",
        "associated_contribution_claims": ["The id of the contribution claim this conclusion supports"],
        "relevance_to_claim": "Precise explanation of how this conclusion supports the contribution claim and its significance",
        "original_conclusions": ["conclusion id 1", "conclusion id 2", ...]
      }}
    ]
    ```

    ## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES

    - Prioritize precision: Never merge conclusions based on different results
    - Maintain completeness: Every original conclusion must be represented in your output
    - Preserve context: Ensure merged descriptions maintain all relevant scientific details
    - Preserve evidence: Keep all evidence locations and spans intact when merging multiple conclusions
    - Focus on deduplication: Your primary goal is identifying redundancies, not summarizing the paper
    - Reference the original text: When uncertain about potential overlaps, examine the full paper
    - No additions: Do *NOT* add more conclusions from the paper, focus only on those extracted.
    - No proactive modifications: Do *NOT* change the conclusion description, copy verbatim where possible.
    - It is perfectly acceptable that the input conclusions are already distinct and do not require merging resulting in a one-to-one mapping.
    - IMPORTANT: No conclusion can occur more than once in the output; if you merge it into one, it should only appear once.

    Begin your analysis now, focusing on producing a comprehensive yet non-redundant set of scientific conclusions.
