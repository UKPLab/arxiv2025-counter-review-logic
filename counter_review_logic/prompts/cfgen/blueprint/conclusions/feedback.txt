    Your task is to analyze the quality of extracted conclusions that supposedly support a list of contribution claims from a scientific paper,
     and provide detailed, constructive feedback. Your task is *not* to evaluate the contribution claims or conclusions
     presented in the paper itself, but rather to assess the coverage and precision of the extraction.

    ## EVALUATION MATERIALS

    ### Original Paper
    {paper}

    ### Contribution Claims
    {contribution_claims}

    ### Extracted Conclusions/Findings Analysis
    {output}

    ## DEFINITION REFINEMENT

    A valid scientific conclusion/interpretation:
    - Is derived from empirical evidence (data, experiments, observations)
    - Represents an interpretation of results, not merely restating raw data
    - Makes a standalone knowledge claim that can be evaluated on its own
    - Uses appropriate scope and certainty language relative to the evidence
    - Is NOT simply restating the contribution claim itself

    ## KEY DISTINCTION: Findings vs. Contribution Claims
    - Findings/conclusions are specific interpretations of individual results
    - Contribution claims are broader statements about the paper's overall value
    - Findings support contribution claims but should be distinct from them
    - Watch for circular reasoning where the "evidence" merely restates the claim

    ## EVALUATION PROTOCOL

    1. DISTINCT IDENTITY CHECK
    - For each identified conclusion, verify it is a genuine finding derived from results and not merely restating a contribution claim
    - Flag any conclusions that appear to be restatements of a contribution claim itself
    - Confirm each conclusion has its own evidence basis independent of the claim it's supporting

    2. COMPREHENSIVENESS ASSESSMENT
    - Identify sections of the paper containing experimental results, analysis, or data interpretation
    - Check if important conclusions from these sections were missed in the analysis
    - Note specific paragraphs, figures, or tables that contain overlooked evidence-based interpretations

    3. VALIDITY VERIFICATION
    - For each extracted conclusion, examine the cited evidence in the original paper
    - Determine if the conclusion reflects the true contents of the paper
    - Verify the logical connection between the conclusion and the contribution claim

    4. EDGE CASE IDENTIFICATION
    - Identify conclusions that fall into challenging categories:
      * Implied but not explicitly stated interpretations
      * Mixed empirical/theoretical statements
      * Context-dependent findings
      * Comparative conclusions that depend on baseline assumptions
      * Statistical interpretations subject to methodological choices

    ## IMPORTANT NOTES
    * You should validate the selection of conclusions and their relevance to the contribution claim.
    * Only if *absolutely necessary* and if there is a *clear relation* to the contribution claim should you suggest adding new conclusions.

    ## FEEDBACK FORMAT

    Your evaluation should be provided in markdown format with these sections:

    # Evaluation of Conclusion Analysis

    ## Overall Assessment
    [Provide a 2-3 paragraph summary of the analysis quality, highlighting major strengths and weaknesses]

    ## Potential Contribution Claim Confusion
    [Identify any "conclusions" that appear to be restatements of the contribution claim rather than distinct findings]
    - **Example:** [Quote the problematic conclusion]
      - **Why it's problematic:** [Explain why this is restating the claim rather than supporting it]
      - **Where to look instead:** [Specific section/paragraph/figure in the paper with actual supporting evidence]

    ## Missing Conclusions
    [List important conclusions from the paper that were omitted but support the claim]
    - **Missing finding:** [Describe the omitted conclusion]
      - **Evidence location:** [Specific reference to where in the paper this conclusion appears or is supported]
      - **Paper section:** [Page number, paragraph number, figure/table reference]
      - **Importance:** [Why this conclusion is essential for supporting the contribution claim]

    ## Problematic Conclusions
    [Identify conclusions that were included but have issues]
    - **Problematic conclusion:** [Quote or reference the specific conclusion]
      - **Issue type:** [Evidence mismatch, overgeneralization, misinterpretation, etc.]
      - **Paper reference:** [Exact location to check in the paper]
      - **Suggested correction:** [How to revise this conclusion to be more accurate]

    ## Edge Case Analysis
    [Analyze conclusions that require special consideration]
    - **Edge case conclusion:** [Quote or reference the specific conclusion]
      - **Type of edge case:** [Implied, context-dependent, comparative, etc.]
      - **Paper context:** [Relevant contextual information from the paper]
      - **Handling recommendation:** [Specific advice on how to properly interpret this finding]

    ## Improvement Actions
    1. [Specific, actionable instruction for improving the analysis]
    2. [Reference exact parts of the paper to check]
    3. [etc.]

    ## Question Prompts for Further Analysis
    - [Targeted question to help resolve an ambiguity in the analysis]
    - [Question about a specific interpretation that needs verification]
