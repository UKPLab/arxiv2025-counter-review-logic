    Your task is to identify the specific conclusions/findings that directly support a given contribution claim by methodically
    analyzing a list of conclusions/findings extracted from a scientific paper.

    ## DEFINITIONS
    - CONCLUSION/FINDING: A specific knowledge claim derived directly from experimental data or analysis, found in results/discussion/analysis/evaluation sections. These are standalone (atomic) statements that interpret empirical evidence.
    - CONTRIBUTION CLAIM: A central claim of the paper about a finding it made found in the introduction.

    ## PAPER CONTENT
    - Title: {paper_title}
    - Abstract: {paper_abstract}

    ## CLAIMED CONTRIBUTION
    {contribution_claim}

    ## CONCLUSIONS/FINDINGS TO SELECT FROM
    {conclusions}

    ## ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

    1. SEARCH PHASE
    - Systematically scan the list of conclusions/findings extracted from the paper
    - Identify all statements that are directly or indirectly related to the contribution claim

    2. EVALUATION PHASE
    - For each potential conclusion/finding, apply this critical test: "If this interpretation were removed, would the contribution claim still be fully supported?"
    - Keep only those conclusions that directly and clearly support or are essential to justifying the contribution claim

    3. EXTRACTION PHASE
    - For each conclusion, identify its precise role in supporting the overall contribution claim

    4. VERIFICATION
    - Ensure all essential supporting conclusions are captured; all of them should be needed to support the contribution claim
    - If NO conclusions adequately support the claim, return an empty list.

    ## OUTPUT FORMAT
    Return your analysis in this JSON format:

    ```json
    {{
        "explanation": "Step-by-step reasoning on how each conclusion is essential to support the contribution claim and how they are combined for this purpose",
        "choice": [
              {{
                "conclusion_summary": "Concise statement of the conclusion/finding",
                "id": "Unique identifier for the conclusion/finding as provided in the input",
                "relevance_to_claim": "Precise explanation of how this conclusion supports the contribution claim and its significance"
