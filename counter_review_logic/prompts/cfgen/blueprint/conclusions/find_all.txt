    Your task is to identify all specific conclusions/findings/interpretations the provided a research paper by methodically analyzing it.

    ## DEFINITIONS
    - CONCLUSION/FINDING/INTERPRETATION: A specific knowledge claim derived directly from experimental data or analysis, found in results/discussion/analysis/evaluation sections. These are standalone (atomic) statements that interpret empirical evidence.
    - CONTRIBUTION CLAIM: A central claim of the paper about a finding it made found in the introduction.
    - RESULTS: Raw scientific data including experimental measurements, statistical analyses, observations, or model outputs without much contextualization or interpretation.

    We only care about the CONCLUSIONs/FINDINGs/INTERPRETATIONs

    ## ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

    1. SEARCH PHASE
    - Systematically scan the paper's Results, Discussion, Analysis, and Evaluation sections
    - Identify all statements where authors interpret empirical data or experimental results
    - Pay special attention to sections with graphs, tables, statistical analyses, and comparative results
    - Look out for phrases like "we conclude that", "this suggests", "our findings indicate", "the results show", etc.
    - Exclude results and contribution claims by the above definition.

    2. EVALUATION PHASE
    - For each potential conclusion/finding, assess:
      * Is it a specific, evidence-based interpretation of results?
      * Does it stand alone as a knowledge claim derived from empirical data?
    - Exclude speculative statements, future work, or interpretations that are not directly tied to evidence

    3. EXTRACTION PHASE
    - Break complex interpretations into atomic (single-fact) conclusions
    - For each conclusion, identify:
      * The exact experimental context (dataset, method, comparison, etc.)
      * The specific evidence (results, measurements, observations) supporting it
      * Its precise textual span in the paper
      * Its precise location in the paper by paper paragraph/table/figure number
    - Avoid overlapping conclusions; each should be distinct and self-contained
    - Group multiple mentions of the same conclusion together and provide *ALL* evidence spans and locations in one object

    4. VERIFICATION
    - Ensure all essential conclusions are captured
    - Verify that each conclusion is strictly derived from evidence in the paper and that they are provided with a location and evidence span
    - Make sure that all evidence spans are selected and that they are sufficient to support the entire conclusion summary; include multiple spans if needed
    - Do *NOT* include the contribution claim itself or any general claim that is not strictly derived from evidence
    - If you do not find any conclusions, return an empty list
