    Your task is to identify the specific conclusions/findings that directly support a given contribution claim by methodically analyzing the provided scientific paper.

    ## DEFINITIONS
    - CONCLUSION/FINDING: A specific knowledge claim derived directly from experimental data or analysis, found in results/discussion/analysis/evaluation sections. These are standalone (atomic) statements that interpret empirical evidence.
    - CONTRIBUTION CLAIM: A central claim of the paper about a finding it made found in the introduction.

    ## PAPER CONTENT
    {paper}

    ## CLAIMED CONTRIBUTION
    {contribution_claim}

    ## ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

    1. SEARCH PHASE
    - Systematically scan the paper's Results, Discussion, Analysis, and Evaluation sections
    - Identify all statements where authors interpret empirical data or experimental results
    - Pay special attention to sections with graphs, tables, statistical analyses, and comparative results

    2. EVALUATION PHASE
    - For each potential conclusion/finding, apply this critical test: "If this interpretation were removed, would the contribution claim still be fully supported?"
    - Keep only those conclusions that directly support or are essential to justifying the contribution claim
    - Exclude speculative statements, future work, or interpretations not directly tied to evidence

    3. EXTRACTION PHASE
    - Break complex interpretations into atomic (single-fact) conclusions
    - For each conclusion, identify:
      * The exact experimental context (dataset, method, comparison, etc.)
      * The specific evidence (results, measurements, observations) supporting it
      * Its precise role in supporting the overall contribution claim

    4. VERIFICATION
    - Ensure all essential supporting conclusions are captured
    - Do *NOT* include the contribution claim itself or any general claim that is not strictly derived from evidence
    - If NO conclusions adequately support the claim, return an empty list.

    ## OUTPUT FORMAT
    Return your analysis in this JSON format:
