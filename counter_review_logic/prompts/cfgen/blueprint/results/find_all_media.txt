    Your task is to identify all results (i.e. empirical evidence) in the figures and tables of an academic paper.
    Your analytical skills and reading experience will help extract precise results.

    ## Task Definition
    Identify and extract all figures and tables that present specific research results (empirical evidence, measurements, data points, statistics).
    Carefully examine the captions of figures and tables, the context they are referenced in the text, and for tables also
    the contents and structure of the table.

    ## Key Definitions
    - **Conclusion**: A general knowledge claim derived from evidence that extends beyond the specific study
    - **Result**: Raw scientific data including experimental measurements, statistical analyses, observations, or model outputs.

    Unlike a conclusion, a result is a specific obervation within the context of the specific study/experiment. It is
    specific and detailed. Not all figures are result figures, some might only illustrate methods or provide background information.
    Likewise, not all tables are result tables summarizing contents or background information. It is key to identify the figures
    and tables that are actually relevant to the experiments and results presented in the paper.

    ## PAPER CONTENT
    {paper}

      ## Step-by-Step Process
    1. Carefully read the entire paper, paying special attention to the methods, results, and discussion sections
    2. Identify all potential results reported in figures and tables. Watch out for references to the figures and tables
       in the text, especially in the results and discussion sections.
    3. For each potential result in a  *FIGURE/TABLE*:
       - Identify the specific data points or observations presented. For figures focus on the caption. For figures also consider the table contents.
       - Summarize the presented data concisely, ensuring it is specific and precise and correctly represents the contents.
       - For tables, describe the structure of the table and provide a step-by-step explanation of how to interpret the table.
    4. Do NOT include results from the text; the output list should only contain results with evidences in figures and tables.

    ## Response Format
    Provide your analysis as a structured JSON array with the following format covering each result:

    ```json
    [
      {{
        "result_summary": "Detailed yet concise description of the specific results presented; for tables a step-by-step explanation of how to interpret the table",
        "evidences": [
            {{
            "location": "Specific figure, or table number",
            "span": "Exact text span from the paper that presents the result; select the caption or if possible a specific cell if it contains the result"
            }},
            ...
        ],
      }}
    ]
    ```
    """
