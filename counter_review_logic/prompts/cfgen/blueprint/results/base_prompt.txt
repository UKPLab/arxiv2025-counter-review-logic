    Your task is to identify specific evidence ("results") that supports a given conclusion in an academic paper.
    Your analytical skills will help extract the precise results that form the foundation of the conclusion.

    ## Input Paper
    Paper: {paper}

    ## Conclusion
    Conclusion: {conclusion}

    ## Task Definition
    Identify and extract all specific results (empirical evidence, measurements, data points, statistics) from the paper that directly support or lead to the stated conclusion.
    The authors should clearly derive the conclusion from those results (i.e., they argumentatively verbalize this connection). You should answer the question: "If this result
    was removed from the paper, would the conclusion still be valid?".

    ## Key Definitions
    - **Conclusion**: A general knowledge claim derived from evidence that extends beyond the specific study
    - **Result**: Raw scientific data including experimental measurements, statistical analyses, observations, or model outputs.

    Unlike a conclusion, a result is a specific obervation within the context of the specific study/experiment.

    ## Step-by-Step Process
    1. Carefully read the entire paper, paying special attention to the methods, results, and discussion sections
    2. Identify all potential results that relate to the provided conclusion
    3. For each result:
       - Summarize the specific data/finding concisely; be specific and precise.
       - Note exactly where it appears (section, paragraph, figure, table). Carefully check that you identify *ALL* locations where this result is discussed or presented in the paper.
       - Explain how this specific result supports or contributes to the conclusion
    4. Group related results together when appropriate
    5. Focus only on results with a clear connection to the conclusion
    6. For each result, find all relevant locations where they are provided in the paper (e.g., paragraphs, figures, tables); only use the paragraph numbers provided in the paper.

    ## Response Format
    Provide your analysis as a structured JSON array with the following format for each result:

    ```json
    [
      {{
        "result_summary": "Detailed yet concise description of the specific data/finding",
        "evidence_location": ["Paragraph no. Y", "Figure Z", "Table N", ...],
        "relevance_to_conclusion": "Clear explanation of how this result directly supports or leads to the conclusion"
      }},
      {{
        "result_summary": "...",
        "evidence_location": ["paragraph x", "Figure y", ...],
        "relevance_to_conclusion": "..."
      }}
    ]
    ```
