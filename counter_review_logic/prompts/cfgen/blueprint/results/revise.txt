    Your task is to identify specific evidence ("results") that supports a set of given conclusion in an academic paper.
    Your analytical skills will help extract the precise results that form the foundation of the conclusion.

    ## Input Paper
    Paper: {paper}

    ## Conclusion
    Conclusions:
     {conclusions}

    ## Task Definition
    Identify and extract all specific results (empirical evidence, measurements, data points, statistics) from the paper that directly support or lead to the stated conclusion.
    The authors should clearly derive the conclusion from those results (i.e., they argumentatively verbalize this connection). You should answer the question: "If this result
    was removed from the paper, would the conclusion still be valid?".

    ## Key Definitions
    - **Conclusion**: A general knowledge claim derived from evidence that extends beyond the specific study
    - **Result**: Raw scientific data including experimental measurements, statistical analyses, observations, or model outputs

    ## Step-by-Step Process
    1. Carefully read the entire paper, paying special attention to the methods, results, and discussion sections
    2. Identify all potential results that relate to the provided conclusion
    3. For each result:
       - Summarize the specific data/finding concisely
       - Note exactly where it appears (section, paragraph, figure, table). Carefully check that you identify *ALL* locations where this result is discussed in the paper.
       - Explain how this specific result supports or contributes to the conclusion
    4. Group related results together when appropriate
    5. Focus only on results with a clear connection to the conclusion

    ## Response Format
    Provide your analysis as a structured JSON array with the following format for each result:

    ```json
      [
      {{
        "result_summary": "Detailed yet concise description of the specific data; for tables a step-by-step explanation of how to interpret the table",
        "id": "Unique identifier for the result",
        "evidences": [
            {{
            "location": "Specific paragraph, figure, or table number",
            "span": "Exact text span from the paper that contains the result in the text; for tables, select the caption or if possible a specific cell if it contains the result"
            }},
            ...
        ],
        "relevance_to_conclusion": "Precise explanation of how this result supports specific conclusion(s)",
        "associated_conclusions": [
          "conclusion id1"
        ]
      }}
      ]
    ```

  Thanks for your answer. Please consider my feedback below and revise your initial answer.

  {feedback}

  NOTE: Remember to provide the revised answer in the exact same json format as the initial answer.
  If you are asked to add additional results, choose a unique id starting with "new_", e.g. "new_res1"; it should not conflict with existing ids.
  Remember to copy all key information from the initial answer, such as the ids and evidence spans.
