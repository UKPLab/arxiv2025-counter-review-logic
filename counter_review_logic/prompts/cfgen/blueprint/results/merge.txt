    Your task is to analyze extracted results from a research paper and eliminate redundancies to produce a concise list of distinct, atomic results.

    ## TASK OVERVIEW
    Analyze the provided research paper results, identify and merge overlapping results, and create a consolidated JSON output that maps each unique result to its relevant conclusions.

    ## INPUT DATA

    ```
    ### Input results:
    {results_with_conclusion_ids}

    ### Relevant conclusions:
    {conclusion_summaries_with_ids}

    ### Paper Content
    {paper}
    ```

    ## DEFINITIONS

    - **Result**: Raw scientific data including experimental measurements, statistical analyses, observations, or model outputs.
    - **Overlapping Results**: Results that report identical or substantially similar data from the same experiment, analysis, or measurement

    ## ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

    1. **Initial Assessment**
       - Read through all extracted results carefully
       - Understand each result's context, methodology, and relationship to paper conclusions
       - Note any potential overlaps or duplications in the data

    2. **Deduplication Process**
       - Compare each result against all others using these criteria:
         * Same experimental setup or methodology?
         * Same measurement parameters?
         * Same dataset being analyzed?
         * Same or very similar numerical findings?
       - For results meeting multiple criteria above, mark as candidates for merging

    3. **Result Consolidation**
       - For identical results: Select the most comprehensive description
       - For partially overlapping results: Create a unified description capturing all unique elements
       - For each merged result:
         * Combine all relevant conclusion IDs
         * Aggregate all location references (figures, tables, paragraphs)
         * Track all original result IDs that contributed to the merged result

    4. **Verification**
       - Cross-reference with the paper text when uncertain about potential overlaps
       - Ensure every original result is accounted for in your final output
       - Verify that merging decisions preserve scientific accuracy and nuance
       - Make sure that the summary of merged results covers all contents of the summaries of the original results

    ## OUTPUT FORMAT

    Return your analysis as a JSON array with this structure:

    ```json
    [
      {{
        "result_summary": "Clear, concise description of the unique scientific finding",
        "evidences": [
          {{
            "location": "Specific paragraph, figure, or table number",
            "span": "Exact text span from the paper that contains the result in the text; for tables, select the caption or if possible a specific cell if it contains the result"
          }}
        ],
        "relevance_to_conclusion": "Precise explanation of how this result supports specific conclusion(s)",
        "original_results": ["ID1", "ID2"],
        "associated_conclusions": ["conclusion id1", "conclusion id2"]
      }}
    ]
    ```

    ## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES

    - Prioritize precision: Never merge results from different experiments
    - Maintain completeness: Every original result must be represented in your output
    - Preserve context: Ensure merged descriptions maintain all relevant scientific details
    - Focus on deduplication: Your primary goal is identifying redundancies, not summarizing the paper
    - Reference the original text: When uncertain about potential overlaps, examine the full paper
    - No additions: Do *NOT* add more results from the paper, focus only on those extracted.
    - No proactive modifications: Do *NOT* change the result description, copy verbatim where possible.
    - Spend special attention to the detailed metrics, statistical significance claims etc. and make sure to maintain them in the result summaries
    - Also do not drop any potential interpretations that are present in the result summaries, integrate them in case of overlap.
    - IMPORTANT: No result can occur more than once in the output; if you merge it into one, it should only appear once.

    Begin your analysis now, focusing on producing a comprehensive yet non-redundant set of scientific findings.
