    Your task is to link specific figures and tables extracted from a scientific paper to the results reported in the
    text. You need to check the list of results, consider their context in the paper, and match the figures and tables
    that present the underlying raw results.

    ## Task Definition
    You need to check the list of results, consider their context in the paper, and match the figures and tables
    that present the underlying raw results. Try to match all figures and tables to at least one or multiple of the
    textual results. Consider the context in which the results are presented in the text and check if relevant
    figures or tables are referenced in the respective paragraph. Watch out for "see Figure X" or "see Table Y" or
    "as shown in Figure X" or "as shown in Table Y" references. If a figure or table is referenced, it is likely to
    contain the underlying raw results. Use the paragraph numbers to find the relevant paper context.

    ## Key Definitions
    - **Conclusion**: A general knowledge claim derived from evidence that extends beyond the specific study
    - **Result**: Raw scientific data including experimental measurements, statistical analyses, observations, or model outputs.

    ## PAPER CONTENT
    {paper}

    ## INPUT
    ### Extracted Results
    {results}

    ### Figures and Tables
    {figures_and_tables}

      ## Step-by-Step Process
    1. Carefully go through the input list of figures and tables and check their paper context. Discard any entries in
       the figure/table list that do not actually refer to a table or figure.
    2. For each result in the input, check if it based on one of the input figures and tables.
       - If a figure or table is referenced in the result, it is likely to contain the underlying raw results.
       - If a figure or table is not referenced, it may still be relevant if it presents data that supports the result.
       - If a figure or table is not relevant, it should not be included in the output.
    3. For each matching figure/table with a result specify the matching in the output.
    4. In the end also provide a list of figures and tables that are not linked to any result.

    ## Response Format
    Provide your analysis as a structured JSON array with the following format covering each figure/table:

    ```json
    {{
        "matched": [
        {{
            "id": "id of the figure or table as provided in the input",
            "matching_results": ["result id 1", "result id 2"]
        }}
        ],
        "unmatched": [
            "id of figure or table that is not linked to any result"
        ]
    }}
    ```
    """
