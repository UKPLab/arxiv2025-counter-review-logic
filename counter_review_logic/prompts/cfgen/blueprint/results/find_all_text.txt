    Your task is to identify all results (i.e. empirical evidence) in an academic paper.
    Your analytical skills and reading experience will help extract precise results.

    ## Task Definition
    Identify and extract all specific results (empirical evidence, measurements, data points, statistics) from the paper. In the text, watch out for markers such as
    specific measurements, statistical analyses, experimental observations, or model outputs. Do NOT include general conclusions or contribution claims that are not
    the evidence itself.

    ## Key Definitions
    - **Conclusion**: A general knowledge claim derived from evidence that extends beyond the specific study
    - **Result**: Raw scientific data including experimental measurements, statistical analyses, observations, or model outputs.

    Unlike a conclusion, a result is a specific obervation within the context of the specific study/experiment. It is
    specific and detailed.

    ## PAPER CONTENT
    {paper}

      ## Step-by-Step Process
    1. Carefully read the entire paper, paying special attention to the methods, results, and discussion sections
    2. Identify all potential results reported in the text and have a close look at figures and tables.
    3. For each potential result described in the *TEXT*:
       - Identify the precise locations in the paper by the paragraph number and clearly identify the exact text spans
         that contain the result.
       - Make sure that all evidence spans are selected and that they are sufficient to support the entire result summary; include multiple spans if needed. No
         information in the summary should be missing in the spans.
       - Summarize the specific data concisely; be specific and precise.
       - Carefully check that you identify *ALL* locations where this result is reported or referred to in the paper.
    4. Group related results together when appropriate but maintain all distinct locations from the text in the evidences.

    ## Response Format
    Provide your analysis as a structured JSON array with the following format covering each result:

    ```json
    [
      {{
        "result_summary": "Detailed yet concise description of the specific data; for tables a step-by-step explanation of how to interpret the table",
        "evidences": [
            {{
            "location": "Specific paragraph number",
            "span": "Exact text span from the paper that contains the result in the text"
            }},
            ...
        ],
      }},
      {{
        "result_summary": "...",
        "evidences": [
            {{
            "location": "Specific paragraph number",
            "span": "Exact text span from the paper that contains the result in the text"
            }},
            ...
        ],
      }}
    ]
    ```
