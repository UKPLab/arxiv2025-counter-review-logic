    Your task is to identify the specific results that directly support a given conclusion/finding/interpretation by methodically
    analyzing a list of results extracted from a scientific paper.

    ## DEFINITIONS
    - CONCLUSION/FINDING: A specific knowledge claim derived directly from experimental data or analysis, found in results/discussion/analysis/evaluation sections. These are standalone (atomic) statements that interpret empirical evidence.
    - RESULT: Raw scientific data including experimental measurements, statistical analyses, observations, or model outputs.

    ## PAPER CONTEXT
    - Title: {paper_title}
    - Abstract: {paper_abstract}

    ## CONCLUSION
    {conclusion}

    ## RESULTS TO SELECT FROM
    {results}

    ## ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

    1. SEARCH PHASE
    - Systematically scan the list of results extracted from the paper
    - Identify all statements that are directly or indirectly related to the conclusion

    2. EVALUATION PHASE
    - For each potential result, apply this critical test: "If this result were removed, would the conclusion still be fully supported?"
    - Keep only those results that directly and clearly support or are essential to justifying the conclusion

    3. EXTRACTION PHASE
    - For each result, identify its precise role in supporting the overall conclusion

    4. VERIFICATION
    - Ensure all essential supporting results are captured; all of them should be needed to support the conclusion
    - If NO results adequately support the conclusion, return an empty list.

    ## OUTPUT FORMAT
    Return your analysis in this JSON format:

    ```json
    {{
        "explanation": "Step-by-step reasoning on how each conclusion is essential to support the contribution claim and how they are combined for this purpose",
        "choice":
            [
              {{
                "result_summary": "Concise statement of the conclusion/finding",
                "id": "Unique identifier for the result as provided in the input",
                "relevance_to_conclusion": "Precise explanation of how this result supports the conclusion and its significance"
              }},

    }}
