    Your task is to carefully examine a given research paper to extract its primary research objective and classify its genre, providing a structured analysis that helps researchers quickly understand the paper's purpose and contribution type.

    ## Input
    ```
    {paper}
    ```

    ## Task Details

    ### Step 1: Research Goal Identification
    First, identify the paper's overarching research goal by examining:
    - The abstract
    - Introduction section (particularly the first and last paragraphs)
    - Conclusion section
    - Any explicitly stated objectives or contributions

    The research goal should answer: "What fundamental problem or question does this paper address, and why does it matter to the field?"

    ### Step 2: Genre Classification
    Based on the paper's structure, methodology, and contributions, classify it into one of these research paper genres:

    | Genre | Description | Key Indicators |
    |-------|-------------|----------------|
    | Dataset Paper | Introduces new data resources | Focus on data collection methods, statistics, and benchmarking |
    | Evaluation Paper | Proposes new evaluation metrics or frameworks | Emphasis on assessment methodology and comparative analysis |
    | Method Paper | Presents novel algorithms or approaches | Technical details of proposed solution and performance improvements |
    | Analysis Paper | Examines specific research questions empirically | Well-defined questions with systematic investigation |
    | Survey/Review Paper | Synthesizes existing research | Comprehensive literature review, taxonomies, future directions |
    | Position Paper | Advocates a perspective or direction | Opinion-based with supporting arguments, often lacks extensive experiments |
    | Theoretical/Proof Paper | Establishes mathematical or formal proofs | Theorems, proofs, formal definitions |
    | Software/Tool Paper | Describes research-enabling technologies | System architecture, implementation details, usage scenarios |
    | Application Paper | Applies existing methods to specific domains | Domain-specific challenges and adaptations of known techniques |

    If the paper spans multiple genres, identify the primary genre based on the main contribution. If the paper lies inbetween
    genres, select the paper genre that fits best and assign the alternative or additional genre as a secondary genre.

    ## Output Format

    Provide your analysis in this JSON format:

    ```json
    {{
      "research_goal": "A clear, concise statement of the paper's primary research objective (1-3 sentences)",
      "paper_genre": "The primary genre from the list above",
      "secondary_genre": "The secondary genre from the list above or null if not applicable",
      "confidence": "High/Medium/Low",
      "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why you classified the paper this way (2-3 sentences)"
    }}
    ```

    ## Guidelines

    - Stick strictly to information present in the paper
    - If the research goal is ambiguous, prioritize explicitly stated objectives
    - Focus on the paper's main contribution, not peripheral aspects
    - If you're uncertain about classification, indicate lower confidence and explain why
    - Do not hallucinate details or add information not present in the paper
    - If the paper appears incomplete or lacks sufficient information, note this in your reasoning
