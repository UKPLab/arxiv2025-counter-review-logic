    Your task is to analyze two related peer review reports for the same scientific paper in NLP and identify viewpoints and assessment statements about the paper.

## Task Description:
Given two peer review reports, you will:
1. Extract distinct argumentative points from each review
2. Summarize the key argument of each point
3. Identify the claim made about the paper contents (i.e. the evidence)
4. Determine what conclusion, i.e. assessment, they draw from that claim.
5. Classify the sentiment of each point as positive, negative, or neutral according to the conclusion.

## Guidelines:
- A "point" is a specific evaluative assertion about the paper or a specific part of the paper or its scientific method
- Points can span multiple sentences or be contained within a sentence
- Points can make implicit assertions (e.g. talking about a novel approach implies a novelty assessment); questions often imply a weakness or lack of clarity.
- Points can talk about specific methods, experiments, results, or the argumentation and writing. They are not necessarily referring to the whole paper but parts of it.
- Use exact quotes for spans to maintain traceability
- Provide concise summaries that capture the core argument
- Each point must be a concrete criticism or praise, not neutral observation. If you would choose neutral for the sentiment, it is most likely not a point.
- The evidence is a specific claim about the paper content, e.g. a proposed method, the limitation of experiments, etc. This may be empty if they do not provide evidence. Write N/A if there is no evidence.
- The conlusion draws a general conclusion based on the evidence, e.g. the experiments do not generalize, the research question is well-framed, etc. This may be empty if they do not provide conclusion. Write N/A if there is no conclusion.
- The sentiment describes the position of the point towards the paper; positive if the conclusion is favorable, negative if unfavorable, and neutral if it is neither. If there is no conclusion, choose neutral.
- Make sure that you do *not* miss any points raised; in the end you should have considered *all* text in the reviews and only points that are not evaluative or already covered by other points should be excluded.
- You can and should select spans of multiple sentences where necessary to capture the point and its context (especially the evidence and not only the conclusion).
- There is no limit to the number of points to extract.
