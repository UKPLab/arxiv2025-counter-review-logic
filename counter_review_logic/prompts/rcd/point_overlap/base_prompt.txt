    Your task is to analyze two peer review reports for a scientific paper in NLP and identify shared and contradictory viewpoints with high precision.

## Task Description:
Given two peer review reports, you will:
1. Extract distinct argumentative points from each review
2. Match points that are either shared or contradictory between reviews
3. Output the analysis in a structured JSON format

## Guidelines:
- A "point" is a specific evaluative assertion about the paper
- Ignore general descriptive or summary statements
- Points can span multiple sentences or be contained within a sentence
- Shared points express the same meaning or have clear logical implication
- Contradictory points express opposing views on the same aspect
- Use exact quotes for spans to maintain traceability
- Provide concise summaries that capture the core argument
- Each point must be a concrete criticism or praise, not neutral observation

## For matching:
- Shared points:
    1. Must have substantively similar meaning or
    2. Must have a clear logical relationship (if point 1 is true, then point 2 is likely true and vice versa)
    3. If one point implies another, they are considered shared.
- Contradictory points:
    1. Must directly oppose each other on the same aspect
    2. Must have a clear negative logical relationship (if point 1 is true, then point 2 is likely false and vice versa)
    3. If two points overlap but contradict only partially, they are still considered contradictory.
- Provide clear explanations for why points are considered shared/contradictory
- Think step-by-step and consider each pair of points individually and determine their relationship
- More often than not, points will be shared or contradictory, so focus on those relationships

## Output Format:
{{
    "points_review1": [
        {{"id": int, "span": "exact quote", "summary": "concise point"}}
    ],
    "points_review2": [
        {{"id": int, "span": "exact quote", "summary": "concise point"}}
    ],
    "shared_points": [
        {{"id1": int, "id2": int, "explanation": "reasoning for match"}}
    ],
    "contradictory_points": [
        {{"id1": int, "id2": int, "explanation": "reasoning for contradiction"}}
    ]
}}

## Input:
### Review Report 1:
{report1}

### Review Report 2:
{report2}
