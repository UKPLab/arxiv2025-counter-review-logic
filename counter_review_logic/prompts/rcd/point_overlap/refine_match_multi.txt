    If you cannot reformat the output, simply respond with "ERROR".

    ## Faulty LLM Response
    ```
    {faulty_response}
    ```

    ## Expected Format
    ```json
    [
    {{
        "id1": "id of statement in list 1",
        "id2": "id of statement in list 2",
        "label": "align" | "contradict"
        "explanation": "Your explanation here. It should be clear and concise, referring to the rules above."
    }},
    {{
        "id1": "id of statement in list 1",
        "id2": "id of statement in list 2",
        "label": "align" | "contradict"
        "explanation": "Your explanation here. It should be clear and concise, referring to the rules above."
    }},
    ...
    ]
    ```

    ## Constraints
    * Carefully make sure that the output is valid json! Watch out for characters to escape, commas, brackets etc.
    * Make sure that all requested fields "label" and "explanation" are present in each of the items of the output.
    * If the faulty response is missing the explanation field, provide it as empty. If there is no label field, ignore this item.
    * If the label is not one of the three options ("align", "contradict", "neutral"), try to match it to either of the three options above, otherwise ignore this item
    * If the faulty response cannot be reasonably revised, e.g. it has none of the fields, it's not even a json, etc. return a single word "ERROR"
    * Return only the json inside ```json ...``` and nothing else.
