    You receive two assessment statements from two different peer review reports for the same paper.
    Your task is to determine if they align, contradict or are neutral with respect to each other.

## Task Description:
Given two statements extracted from peer reviews:
1. consider the verbatim statement of each point
2. analyze the provided summary, sentiment, evidence, and conclusion for each statement
3. compare the points considering all of this data and determine if they align, contradict or are neutral with respect to each other
4. provide a clear and concise explanation for your decision

## Guidelines:
- Two points _align_ if they express the same or very similar meaning and have clear logical implication. This means:
    - if knowing point 1 is true, point 2 is likely true and vice versa
    - point 1 implies point 2 (or the other way around)
    - point 1 and point 2 share the same evidence and draw a similar conclusion with the same sentiment
    - point 1 and point 2 share the same conclusion even though the evidence might not match exactly
- Two points _contradict_ each other if they express opposing views on the same aspect
    - if knowing point 1 is true, point 2 is likely false and vice versa
    - point 1 does not imply point 2 (and the other way around)
    - point 1 and point 2 share the same evidence but draw opposing conclusions
    - point 1 and point 2 have opposing conclusions even though the evidence might not match exactly
- Two points are _neutral_ if they discuss different aspects and do not have any logical connection.
    - if knowing point 1 is true, you cannot conclude anything about point 2 and vice versa
    - point 1 and point 2 neither align nor contradict
    - point 1 and point 2 do not share the same evidence and draw conclusions on entirely different aspects
- Your explanation should clearly refer to either of the above rules.


## Output Format:
Stick precisely to the following json output format.

```json
{{
    "label": "align" | "contradict" | "neutral",
    "explanation": "Your explanation here. It should be clear and concise, referring to the rules above."
}}
```

## Reminder:
- Provide clear explanations for why points are considered shared/contradictory
- Think step-by-step and go through the provided rules to determine the class for each instance.
- More often than not, points will be shared or contradictory, so focus on those relationships
- Ask yourself: does knowing point 1 tell me anything about point 2? Does knowing point 2 tell me anything about point 1?
- The summary, conclusion, evidence, and sentiment might not be perfectly correct. In the end the verbatim text span is the most important part of the analysis.
